Snyder draws on various historical examples, including the collapse of the Soviet Union, the rise of fascism, and the ongoing war in Ukraine, to demonstrate how freedom requires a commitment to truth, solidarity, and unpredictability. He also analyzes the impact of technology, particularly social media, on our understanding of freedom and its implications for the future of democratic societies.
