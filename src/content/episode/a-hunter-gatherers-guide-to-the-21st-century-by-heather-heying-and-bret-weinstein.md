The authors, Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein, argue that modern society's problems, such as the obsession with growth and the prevalence of mismatch diseases, are rooted in a disconnect between our modern lifestyle and our evolutionary past. 

They suggest that to overcome these challenges, we must understand our evolutionary history, learn from the wisdom of our ancestors, and use a more holistic approach to our lives. They explore a wide range of topics, including food, sleep, sex and gender, parenthood, childhood, school, culture, and consciousness, emphasizing the importance of finding a balance between tradition and innovation, and embracing a more cautious and exploratory mindset in the face of accelerating novelty.
