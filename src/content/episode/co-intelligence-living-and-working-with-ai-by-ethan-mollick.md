Mollick argues that LLMs are not simply sophisticated software programs, but rather co-intelligences that can be viewed as alien beings capable of performing tasks traditionally thought to be exclusively human. He proposes a framework for working with AI, suggesting we treat it as a partner, engaging in collaboration and delegation. The book examines the strengths and limitations of LLMs, explores ethical considerations related to their development and use, and provides practical guidance for individuals and organizations seeking to harness the potential of AI while mitigating potential risks.
