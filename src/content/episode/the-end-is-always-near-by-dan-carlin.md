Carlin, a podcast host, uses a blend of storytelling and historical research to examine the common thread of societal collapse throughout history. The book analyzes various factors that have contributed to the downfall of civilizations, including pandemics, climate change, warfare, and the impact of "toughness" in times of hardship. Carlin also considers the role of societal organization and technology in shaping civilization's trajectory, and the potential consequences of nuclear warfare in the modern era.
