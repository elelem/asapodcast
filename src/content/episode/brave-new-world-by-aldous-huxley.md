**The World State** emphasizes stability and happiness, and its citizens are kept content through the use of soma, a powerful drug that suppresses all negative emotions. John, however, struggles to adapt to this new world and finds himself repulsed by its superficiality and lack of individual freedom. **Through John's experiences**, the novel explores the dangers of totalitarianism, the importance of individual expression, and the complexities of human nature.
