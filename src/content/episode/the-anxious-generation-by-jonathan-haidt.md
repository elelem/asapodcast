He uses data from the US, UK, and other countries to support his claim that these technologies contribute to anxiety, depression, sleep deprivation, and addiction. The book explores how technology has changed childhood, advocating for a “play-based childhood” with more time for unstructured play and less time for screen time. It further proposes solutions to this crisis, calling on governments, technology companies, and schools to create policies that protect children from the harmful effects of technology and promote a healthier and more balanced childhood.
