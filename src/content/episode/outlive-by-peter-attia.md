The author, a physician and researcher, argues that modern medicine, known as Medicine 2.0, often focuses on treating disease after it has manifested, resulting in a limited healthspan. He proposes a new paradigm, Medicine 3.0, that emphasizes preventive measures and lifestyle interventions to extend both lifespan and healthspan. Attia explores various factors influencing longevity, including nutrition, exercise, sleep, and emotional health, and presents evidence-based strategies for optimizing each. He delves into the biological mechanisms underlying common diseases of aging and provides actionable advice for mitigating risk and improving overall health. The book aims to empower readers to take control of their health journey and make informed decisions for a longer, healthier, and more fulfilling life.
